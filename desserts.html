110g (1/2 cup) caster sugar
170g (2/3 cup) mascarpone
2 tsp vanilla essence
2 egg whites
Strawberries, halved, extra, to serve

Step 1
Place the 500g strawberries, sliced with 1 tablespoon of the caster sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until the sugar dissolves and strawberries soften. Remove from the heat. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and place in the freezer for 10 minutes to cool.
Step 2
Place the 170g (2/3 cup) mascarpone, strawberry mixture and 2 tsp vanilla essence in a bowl. Use a large spoon to fold until just combined (do not over-mix).
Step 3
Use electric beaters to beat the 2 egg whites in a separate bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining sugar until thick and glossy. Use a large metal spoon to gently fold the egg white mixture into the mascarpone mixture until just combined. Spoon among serving glasses. Decorate with the Strawberries, halved, extra, to serve to serve.
