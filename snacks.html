Directions
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper for easy cleanup, and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine Rice Chex™, Honey Nut Chex™, pretzels, Cheddar crackers, and peanuts.

Stir butter, Buffalo sauce, ranch mix, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Pour over the snack mix and stir until everything is well coated. Spread mixture in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets.

Bake in the preheated oven until crisped and golden, about 1 hour, stirring halfway through. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with sea salt flakes, and cool completely before serving.
